    <img src="img.01" width="800px" height="400px">
    <p><b>Taj Mahal</b>, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān(reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern(right) bank of the Yamuna(Jumna) River. Agra Fort(Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna,is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.
      <br>
      <br>
    <h3>History of construction</h3>
    The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the ottoman Empre, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In ttal, constrution of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>

    <img src="img.02" width="800px" height="400px">
    <p>The <b>Red Fort </b>or <b>Lal Qila</b>is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
      <br>
      <br>
      On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public Address System of Indian Army Signals.The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.

    <p>The <b>Charminar</b> is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.<br><br>
      The fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built the Charminar in 1591 after shifting his capital from Golconda to the newly formed city of Hyderabad.The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen down after being struck by lighting. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh.</p>

    <br>
    <img src="img.04" width="800px" height="400px">
    <p>The <b>Gateway of India</b> is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture.The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914,and construction was completed in 1924.The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt,which is 26 metres(85 feet)high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.
      <br>
      <br>
  After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at itspremises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.</p>

    <img src="img.06" width="800px" height="400px">
    <p>In Delhi, India, stands the <b>Qutb Minar</b>, one of the tallest minarets—towers from which Muslims are called to prayer—in Asia. It is made largely of red sandstone. Rising 238 feet (72.5 meters), the Qutb Minar is the tallest stone tower in India. It was built by the first rulers of the Delhi sultanate in the early 1200s. Construction began about 1199 under the ruler Qutb al-Din Aibak and was completed by his successor, Iltutmish—both of the Slave dynasty. The Qutb Minar and its surrounding monuments were declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO (a United Nations agency) in 1993. The tower is a landmark of Indian architecture.
    <br><br>
    As a minaret, the Qutb Minar has balconies from which the faithful are called to prayer five times each day. It is attached to the Quwat ul-Islam mosque. An inscription on the Qutb Minar indicates that the tower also served as a victory monument, to celebrate the Delhi sultanate’s defeat of a rival kingdom.The Qutb Minar was damaged by lightning and earthquakes in the 14th and 15th centuries. The tower was then rebuilt and repaired by local rulers. In the early 16th century the ruler Sikandar, of the Delhi sultanate’s Lodi dynasty, undertook a more-extensive restoration. He also had its top two tiers expanded.</p>

    <p>The <b>Hawa Mahal</b> is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India.

    <br><br>
    It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad.Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.

    <p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace,is a historical palace and a royal residence (house). It is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward.

    The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Swapna built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.</p>

    <img src="img.10" width="800px" height="400px">
    <p><b>Golconda</b> or <b>Golconda Fort</b> is a fortified citadel and ruined city located in the western part of Hyderabad, in present-day Telangana, India.The present structure, which was historically known as Qila Muhammadnagar,was built by the Qutb Shahi Sultans of Golconda, during the reign of the first three Sultans, Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah, and Subhan Quli Qutb Shah.<br><br>
    A previous mud-fort built during the reign of Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century existed before the current structure.It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (1358–1375 A.D.) of the Bahmani Sultanate.Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified the city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins.</p>
